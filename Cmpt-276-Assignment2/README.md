# CMPT-276 Assignment 2: Student CURD App

## Description:
A CRUD app connected to a PostgreSQL database holding student data. Each student has a name, weight, height, gpa and hair color. The app allows the user to have students displayed as boxes of varying appearances based on the student's attributes.

## Features:
- Create new students.
- Read existing students.
- Update student data.
- Delete students.
- Display students as boxes of different sizes and name text colors.

## Potentially important information:
Currently, the app has quite a few limitations:
- Student names cannot be edited, everything else can be.
- Only supporting a very small variety of student information. I did not have enough strength to implement more.
- Horrendous masses of spaghetti code everywhere. I am ashamed.
- Unknown bugs here and there.
